# OSRS-Server-Pinger
A simple Python script to check your current ping on the various Old School RuneScape servers.

Run the script and you will be presented with a prompt asking you what commando you would like to do.
It is possible to ping all servers or filter to only ping F2P or members (P2P) servers.
If you wish to ping a specific server simply enter the number of that server, eg. 2 for World 2.
